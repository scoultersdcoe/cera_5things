Hi- 

My name is Shannon Coulter and I am the Director of Research and Evaluation at the San Diego County Office of Education.

Before that, I was an assistant professor at Dalton State College and the University of Tennessee. I also spent 8 years working in alternative education in San Diego.

Today I wanted to share with you some of the strategies I developed over the past 3 years

to support low-income students to access and succeed in college.

## Graduating from College Matters<br>
College graduates have 65% higher earnings compared to a high school graduate (College Board, 2013). Additionally, nearly 93% of students intend to enroll in college in 9th grade, but only 60% attend, and fewer than four in 10 earn a degree.

### Bottleneck #1: Which college should I apply to and enroll?

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Choice Conflict]

Low-income students have too many choices and decisions to make. They weigh too many factors and experience choice paralyzation.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Hurdles]
The complexity of the process discourages many from applying to more competitive colleges.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Limited Attention]
Any student only has a finite capacity for engaging in the college enrollment process due to its complexity and length. For low-income students, their attention competes with other priorities such as job schedules, taking care of siblings, and others.

### Bottleneck #2: How can I afford college?

----

--

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Identity]

Low-income students who experience small hurdles in the process can cause disproportionate drop-off and create identity conflict where these students begin asking: Is college right for me?
]

.panel[.panel-name[Defaults]
Most students default to the minimum or the status quo. Many of the defaults regarding the FAFSA/Dream Act application bounce students out of process.

### Bottleneck #3: Do I still want to go to college?

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Procrastination]

Most students experience procrastination especially during the summer, where they carry out less urgent tasks in preference to more urgent ones, and thus putting off more impending college enrollment tasks to a later time, sometimes to the “last minute” before the deadline.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Salience]
Low-income students keep the most pressing information at the forefront of their minds. Important college enrollment task my not be prioritized like other tasks such as paying an electricity bill.
